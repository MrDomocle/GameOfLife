# Game of Life in JavaScript
Pure HTML+CSS+JavaScript.  
Wonder what it is? [Life Wiki](https://conwaylife.com/).  
Written in a couple of weeks with a focus on good looks.  
You can paste RLE or Plaintext patterns from different places, like the [Life Wiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/).  
Just copy the text inside the `.rle` or `.cells` file and Ctrl+V it into the game field.
